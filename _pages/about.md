👋 Hi, I'm Zhanli Li (李展利), currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in **Digital Economy** (2023-2027) at the Wenlan School of Business, Zhongnan University of Economics and Law (ZUEL). During my time at ZUEL, I've had the privilege of meeting an amazing group of senior students with incredible insights into deep learning. Their achievements have inspired me to explore the exciting field of AI—especially [Kaichen Xu (徐恺辰)](https://catchxu.github.io/) and [Yihang Du (杜艺航)](https://yihdu.github.io/), whose work has powerfully proven the potential of ZUEL students in top-tier AI research.

🎓 From 2024 to February 2025, I was honored to be mentored by [Prof. Zichao Yang (杨子超)](https://www.yzc.me) at ZUEL, where our research focused on **machine learning**, **tabular data**, and **applied microeconometrics**. Currently, I am an intern of [Prof. Yixuan Cao (曹逸轩)](https://yixuancao.github.io/) at the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and [PAI TECH (庖丁科技)](https://www.paodingai.com/). Together with the advanced PDF parsing model ([PDFlux](https://pdflux.com/en/)) developed by [Prof. Ping Luo (罗平)](https://ping-luo.github.io/)'s team, we are committed to building a **multi-document Q&A Agent**.

💡 I am committed to research with practical significance, meaning that the motivation stems from real-world needs or the potential to solve tangible problems. Currently, I am dedicated to **LLM-driven document understanding and reasoning**, with a vision to enable models to **read documents like a human**. My research interests specifically span **Agentic Reinforcement Learning**, **Representation Learning**, and **Information Retrieval**. I hope my solutions are universal and interpretable, grounded in theories that are both intuitive and rigorously sound.

🎯 Although game theory and causal inference have greatly aided my understanding of the world, I currently maintain a neutral stance regarding the rigor and universality of these theories. I do not intend to pursue economics research in the future. Instead, the field of AI is a verifiable domain whose rapid development and swift implementation deeply excite me. This inspires me to dedicate myself to exploring this field in the future, hoping to make a marginal contribution to understanding the world and advancing real-world progress. So I am currently actively seeking PhD positions in the following fields:

- Computer Science
- Data Science
- Statistics
- Fintech

🎶 I am well aware that it is challenging for an undergraduate economics major to pursue a graduate (or PhD) position in computer science, as the lack of systematic CS training is often questioned. Fortunately, I encountered several seniors with similar backgrounds and aspirations. They selflessly shared invaluable experience, helping me avoid many pitfalls. More importantly, their spirit greatly inspired me to persistently pursue my passion, teaching me the profound truth that “Passion is all you need!”

💬 Beyond academic research, I enjoy playing ping pong, throwing a frisbee, taking walks, running, and cycling in my free time. I welcome anyone interested in my work or seeking potential collaborations to reach out via email: lizhanli@stu.zuel.edu.cn
