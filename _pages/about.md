üëã Hi, I'm Zhanli Li (ÊùéÂ±ïÂà©), currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in **Digital Economy**  (2023-2027) at the Wenlan School of Business, Zhongnan University of Economics and Law. 

üéì From 2024 to February 2025, I am honored to be mentored by [Prof. Zichao Yang (Êù®Â≠êË∂Ö)](https://www.yzc.me) of Zhongnan University of Economics and Law. Our research focuses on  **machine learning**, **tabular data** and **applied microeconometrics**. Currently, I am an intern working with [Prof. Yixuan Cao (ÊõπÈÄ∏ËΩ©)](https://yixuancao.github.io/) at the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences and [PAI TECH (Â∫ñ‰∏ÅÁßëÊäÄ)](https://www.paodingai.com/), with the advanced PDF parsing model ([PDFlux](https://pdflux.com/en/)) developed by [Prof. Ping Luo (ÁΩóÂπ≥)](https://ping-luo.github.io/)'s team, we are really committed to building a **multi-document Q&A Agent**.

üí° With the great success of LLMs, there is potential to accomplish many useful downstream applications. However, numerous **hallucinations** and **security** issues exist within this landscape. I hope to realize more **trustworthy** and **secure** downstream applications. I hope these applications are as universal and interpretable as possible, with underlying theories that are both intuitive and rigorously sound.

üéØ I am currently actively seeking PhD position opportunities in the following fields: 
-  Computer Science
-  Data Science
-  Statistics  
-  Fintech

üí¨ If you have any ideas about my work or potential collaborations, feel free to reach out via email: lizhanli@stu.zuel.edu.cn.
